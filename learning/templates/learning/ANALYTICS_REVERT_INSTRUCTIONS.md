## How to Revert to Multi-Subject Version

### Step 1: Backup Current Single-Subject Version (Optional)
```bash
# If you want to keep the single-subject version
cp learning/templates/learning/analytics.html learning/templates/learning/analytics_single_subject_backup.html
```

### Step 2: Restore Multi-Subject Version
```bash
# Copy the backup over the current file
cp learning/templates/learning/analytics_multi_subject_backup.html learning/templates/learning/analytics.html
```

### Step 3: Update Backend Data (if needed)
If you've added new subjects to your database, update the analytics view in `learning/analytics.py` to include:
- New subject progress data
- Achievement data for multiple subjects
- Performance metrics across subjects

### Step 4: Test the Restored Version
1. Restart Django server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Navigate to analytics page
3. Verify all subjects display correctly
4. Check progress bars and metrics

## Key Differences Between Versions

### Single Subject (Current)
- **Title**: "Digital Literacy Analytics"
- **Hero Section**: Large progress display for Digital Literacy
- **Skill Breakdown**: 4 digital literacy sub-skills
- **Achievements**: Digital-focused achievements
- **Layout**: Optimized for one subject with detailed breakdown

### Multi-Subject (Backup)
- **Title**: "Learning Analytics"
- **Subject Cards**: Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies

- **Layout**: Grid layout accommodating multiple subjects

## When to Revert
✅ **Revert when you:**
- Add more subjects to your curriculum
- Need to track multiple academic areas

❌ **Keep single-subject when you:**
- Only have Digital Literacy curriculum
- Want detailed digital skills breakdown
- Prefer focused, detailed analytics
- Students are primarily learning computer skills
